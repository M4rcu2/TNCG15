Ray-tracing madness epic booga-loo

Hello fellow TNCG15 traveller! I have to say that you are very brave to venture this path! 
This is a course that many have tried and many have failed! The road ahead is a dangerous one, 
not for the faint of heart. However, those who prevail will find themselves with a new found
knownledge. This repository is public because I forgot to turn it to private. If you take code
from this repository... nothing will happen. However, I highly encourage you to try it first
for yourself! Get an understanding of what you are supposed to do! There are plenty of ways to
implement the raytracer! And most of all... Try to have fun! (Even in the darkest of times!)

I highly recommend watching this video to get a solid grasp of the concepts. (Especially the first
couple of minutes) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsZiJeaMO48

I wish you the best of luck!
